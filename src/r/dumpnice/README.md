## How to regenerate

Run the organizer from the repository root:

```bash
Rscript src/r/tools/organize_dumpnice.R
```

Optionally specify source and destination directories:

```bash
Rscript src/r/tools/organize_dumpnice.R note/04DumpNice src/r/dumpnice
```

## How to load all functions

In an interactive R session:

```r
source('src/r/load_dumpnice.R')
# or with verbose output
options(dumpnice.verbose = TRUE)
source('src/r/load_dumpnice.R')
```

## Notes

- Files with identical names but different contents are de-duplicated with a numeric suffix (e.g., `file__01.R`).
- Original comments and author information are preserved.
- This is a structural integration; deep function-level deduplication is not attempted automatically.
